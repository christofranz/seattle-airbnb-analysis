    "In this notebook the monthly revenue in $ is investigated based on the AirBnB data from Seattle.\n",

    "The revenue is calculated based on assumptions for the fraction of people staying at the host and not writing a review and an average number for the duration of each stay.\n",

    "The monthly revenue per listing is approximated by:\n",
    "* calculating the months the listings was in use (time period from the first review to the last in months)\n",
    "* counting the reviews during this time to determine the reviews per months\n",
    "* assume that only 50 % of the guests leave a review to obtain the number of guests per month\n",
    "* assume that guests stay on average 3 nights (also used in the model here) to finally calculate the monthly revenue together with an average price per night\n",
